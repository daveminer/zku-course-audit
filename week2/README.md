## Part 1 Hashes and Merkle Tree

#### Q1. Based on the resources we provide you as well as any additional research you have done, compare the four hashes and provide explanations in four different aspects: gas cost, capacity, proof generation efficiency, and proof size. It's ok if you cannot find reference for all four aspects, just do the best you can.

| Gas Cost (hash 2 values) | Capacity | Proof Generation Efficiency | Proof Size

## Part 3 Semaphore

#### Q1. What is Semaphore? Explain in 4-8 sentences how it works.

...

#### Q2. How does Semaphore prevent double signing (or double withdrawal in the case of mixers)? Explain the mechanism in 4-8 sentences.

...

#### Q3. A lot of applications have already been built based on derivations from Semaphore, such as for voting (e.g. AnonyVote), survey or opinion (e.g. Ninja Survey, zkAsk), and authentication (e.g. InterRep, Continuum, zkPayroll). Can you suggest two more ideas for ZK applications that can be built upon Semaphore?
