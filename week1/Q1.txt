1. Explain in 2-4 sentences why SNARK requires a trusted setup while STARK doesnâ€™t.

Elliptic curve cryptography utilizes a hidden parameter which requires an initial secret.
This secret can be used to create false transactions so it must be destroyed to make the network secure.
False proofs through the method above would be undetectable.


2.Name two more differences between SNARK and STARK proofs.

STARKs are based on a hashing mechanism while SNARKs utilize elliptic curve cryptography.
STARKs cost approximately 4x as much gas and have larger proofs compared to SNARKs.
