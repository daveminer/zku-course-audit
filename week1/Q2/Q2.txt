Part 1

1. What does the circuit in HelloWorld.circom do?

Checks that the output is the multiplication of the inputs.


2. Lines 7-12 of compile-HelloWorld.sh download a file called powersOfTau28_hez_final_10.ptau for Phase 1 trusted setup.
Read more about how this is generated here, here, and here. What is a Powers of Tau ceremony?
Explain why this is important in the setup of zk-SNARK applications.

This is important because it makes it much more likely that the "master key" is irretrievable since each contributor
to the ceremony can destroy their own toxic value to make it so.


3. Line 24 of compile-HelloWorld.sh makes a random entropy contribution as a Phase 2 trusted setup.
How are Phase 1 and Phase 2 trusted setup ceremonies different from each other?

Phase 2 makes Phase 1 more balanced as it removes the ability for the final participant to influence key properties.

Part 2

2. error[T3001]: Non quadratic constraints are not allowed! "a * b * c" is not a quadratic expression.

3. No trusted setup is needed for PLONK as it is Universal.

4. PLONK is more complex than Groth16.
