Part 3

1. 'contracts/circuits/LessThan10.circom' implements a circuit that verifies an input is less than 10 using the LessThan template.
Study how the template is used in this circuit. What does the 32 in Line 9 stand for?

32 represents the number of bits the input can have.


What are the possible outputs for the LessThan template and what do they mean respectively?
(If you cannot figure this out by reading the code alone, feel free to compile the circuit and test with different input values.)

Possible outputs for LessThan are booleans values; true and false.
